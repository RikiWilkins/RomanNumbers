1. Install the Cake bootstrapper
The bootstrapper is used to download Cake and the tools required by the build script.
Windows
Invoke-WebRequest https://cakebuild.net/download/bootstrapper/windows -OutFile build.ps1
Linux
curl -Lsfo build.sh https://cakebuild.net/download/bootstrapper/linux
OS X
curl -Lsfo build.sh https://cakebuild.net/download/bootstrapper/osx
2. Create a Cake script
Add a cake script called build.cake to the same location as the bootstrapper script that you downloaded.
var target = Argument("target", "Default");

Task("Default")
  .Does(() =>
{
  Information("Hello World!");
});

RunTarget(target);
3. Run it!
Windows
# Execute the bootstrapper script.
./build.ps1
